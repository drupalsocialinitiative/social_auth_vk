INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth Vkontkate Module is a Vkontkate Authentication integration for Drupal.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

 * Composer Manager (https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_manager):
   This module will help to install the League PHP library and Vkontkate base library for the league,
   which are the libraries required to make user authentication.

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Download Vkontkate Base Library for TheLeague OAuth2 PHP library
   (https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-vkontkate). We recommend to use
   Composer Manager module to install the library.

 * Install the dependencies: Social API and Social Auth.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your Vkontkate project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » Vkontkate.

 * Place a Social Auth Vkontkate block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

User can click on the Vkontkate logo on the Social Auth Login block
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/vkontkate, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

When the user opens the /user/login/vkontkate link, it automatically takes
user to Vkontkate Accounts for authentication. Vkontkate then returns the user to
Drupal site. If we have an existing Drupal user with the same email address
provided by Vkontkate, that user is logged in. Otherwise a new Drupal user is
created.
